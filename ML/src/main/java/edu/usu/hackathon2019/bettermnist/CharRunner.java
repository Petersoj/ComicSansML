     * The objective of this Neural Network Deep Learning and Generation Application is to create a CNN
     * (Convolutional Neural Network) that is capable of identifying and classifying characters regardless of what font or
     * style that are in. Some fonts have extra detail and features that can cause other trained models to return
     * false positives in classification. The idea here is that we can perpetually generate thousands of character rasters
     * of different font faces and then apply raster warping/filtering to more accurately model a real world situation
     * in which the Network is given a slightly warped picture of a character or perhaps even a picture of something
     * handwritten.
